// the glich with page reload is still prevelant, however I can use redirects to make the site still work out. I also need to implement better 
// verification for my json files 

// also need to implement GET routes for posts 

// Thinking of postponing other models and simply adding a subject tag to the post model for the time being


// FRONTEND PLANS 

Homepage.htmk => sign up && login => add post && view post 

after adding post, there will be a prompt to add files to post. This will later redirect in a new window to a confirmation or 
error page. THIS IS ONLY NEEDED FOR ROUTES WITH FILE UPLOADS, SO ONLY ONE ROUTE.
